# Numbers

## Types of numbers

<p>Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.

Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python. </p>

# Variable Assignment

<p>We use a single equals sign to assign labels to variables.</p>
<ul>
 <p> The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:</p>

<li> Names can not start with a number.
<li> There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.</li>
<li> Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+</li>
4<li>It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.</li>
5<li>Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), 
   or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.</li>
<li> Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"</li>
</ul>
# Dynamic Typing

<p>ython uses dynamic typing, meaning you can reassign variables to different data types. This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types; it differs from other languages that are statically typed.</p>

<ul>
<li>very easy to work with</li>
<li>faster development time</li>
<li>may result in unexpected bugs!</li>
<li>you need to be aware of type()</li>
</ul>

# Determining Variable Type

You can check what type of object is assigned to a variable using Python's built-in type() function. Common data types include:

int (for integer)
float
str (for string)
list
tuple
dict (for dictionary)
set
bool (for Boolean True/False)
