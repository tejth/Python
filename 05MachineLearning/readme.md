# Machine Learning
<p>M.L is a way to automatically create models that can analyze data and make predictions or decisions without needing to be explicitly programmed to perform those tasks.</p>

# Types of ML algorithm
<ul>
  <li>Supervised Learning :- Supervised Learning:
Definition: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. It's like having a teacher supervise the learning process.
Example: Imagine you have a dataset of emails, each labeled as "spam" or "not spam." You train a supervised learning algorithm (like a decision tree or a neural network) on this data to learn the patterns that distinguish spam from non-spam emails. Once trained, the algorithm can predict whether new, unseen emails are spam or not based on the patterns it has learned from the labeled data.</li>

<li>Unsupervised Learning:

Definition: Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
Example: Consider a dataset containing customer data with no predefined labels. An unsupervised learning algorithm (like k-means clustering or principal component analysis) can analyze this data to group customers with similar behaviors together.  </li>

  Reinforcement Learning:

Definition: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It learns through trial and error by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
Example: Think of teaching a dog new tricks. You give the dog treats (reward) when it performs the desired action correctly and ignore it (no reward) or give a gentle correction (penalty) when it doesn't. The dog learns to associate actions with consequences and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, an algorithm (like Deep Q-Learning or policy gradients) learns to navigate a maze or play a game by receiving rewards (or punishments) based on its actions, ultimately aiming to maximize its cumulative reward over time.
