# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to simplify data while retaining its key patterns and trends. It works by transforming a set of possibly correlated variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

## Here’s a simple explanation with an example:

->Imagine you have a dataset with information about houses, including variables like square footage, number of bedrooms, and price.</br>
PCA would analyze how these variables relate to each other. It might find that square footage and number of bedrooms are closely related (correlated), </br>
meaning when one increases, the other tends to increase as well.</br></br>

->PCA then creates new variables (principal components) that capture the most variation in the original data. </br>
For instance, the first principal component might combine square footage and number of bedrooms into a single score that represents overall size.</br>
This new score would retain most of the important information from both original variables.</br></br>
  

->PCA helps in reducing the complexity of data by focusing on the most important aspects, making it easier to interpret and analyze large datasets</br>
It’s widely used in fields like image processing, finance, and genetics to uncover underlying structures and relationships in data.  </br></br>
