# Support Vector Machines algorithm

## Explanation:

SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.
It aims to maximize the margin (distance) between the nearest data points (support vectors) of different classes.
## Example:

->Scenario: Suppose you have a dataset of animals classified as either dogs or cats based on their weight and height.

->Data:

Features: Weight and Height of animals </br>
Target: Dog or Cat (binary classification) </br>

## SVM:
SVM will find a hyperplane (in this case, a line since it's 2D) that best separates dogs from cats.
The hyperplane is positioned to maximize the distance between the nearest dogs and cats, which are the support vectors.
Use Case:

## Real-life Example: Imagine you are working on a project to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).
Features: The features could include word frequencies, presence of specific keywords, etc. </br>
Target: The target would be spam or non-spam. </br>
Application: SVM can learn from labeled emails (spam or non-spam) to build a model that can classify new, unseen emails into spam or non-spam categories.</br>
