# K-Means Clustering
## Explanation:

Objective: K-Means aims to group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns in the data.</br>
Process: It iteratively assigns data points to K clusters based on their features and computes cluster centroids (the mean of all points in the cluster), adjusting them until convergence.</br>
## Example:

-> Scenario: Suppose you have a dataset of customers based on their annual income and spending score.

-> Data:

Features: Annual Income (in thousands) and Spending Score (1-100).
## K-Means Clustering: </br>

Step 1: Choose the number of clusters, K.
Step 2: Initialize K centroids randomly.
Step 3: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
Step 4: Recalculate the centroids of the clusters as the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids converge or a specified number of iterations is reached.
## Use Case:

->Real-life Example: In customer segmentation for a retail business, K-Means can group customers into clusters based on their spending behavior and income levels.</br> </br>
->Application: By identifying different customer segments (e.g., high-income, low-spending versus low-income, high-spending), businesses can tailor marketing strategies or product offerings more effectively.
